What colour can be found in an autumn day? 

What sound can be heard in an autumn day?

Yellow, a sound installation, aims to explore the organisation of found sounds from the environment, and putting back into the same environment for arousing the audience to notice the overlooked sounds in the realistic environment. The premiere was exhibited at the National Arboretum Canberra, where sounds were sourced.

In todayâ€™s urban life, many beautiful sounds are often ignored, because we are too busy to listen; also, due to the noise pollution, the sonic environment is occupied by loud noises. Autumn is colourful in Canberra; the leaves turn to yellow. We can easily notice the change of colour; however, we often ignore the sounds of yellow leaves. I recorded these sounds of dry leaves, including the steps, showering and wind blowing. I edited them, and coded them in the cSound platform. Finally, I took them back to the environment via two of my homemade speakers.
